    <h1>Are You Playing Banjo</h1>

    <p>Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?". If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower
        case "r", you are playing banjo! The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following
        strings:

    </p>

    <p>name + " plays banjo" name + " does not play banjo"</p>
