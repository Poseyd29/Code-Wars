    <h1>Sentence Smash/h1>

        <p>Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence.
            You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be
            careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!</p>

        <p>Example ['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great'] => 'hello world this is great'</p>
