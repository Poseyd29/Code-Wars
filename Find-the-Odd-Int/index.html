    <h1>Find the Odd Int</h1>

    <p>Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times. There will always be only one integer that
        appears an odd number of times. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).</li>
        <li>[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).</li>
        <li>[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).</li>
        <li>[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).</li>
        <li>[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1]</li>
    </ul>
