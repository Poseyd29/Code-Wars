    <h1>Return Negative</h1>

    <p>In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of
        the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty
        or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).</p>

    <p>Examples: "ATTGC" --> "TAACG", "GTAT" --> "CATA"</p>
